Classifying Political Point of View using Naive Bayes and RNN Models
Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using different models to understand and compare their performance. The models include:

Naive Bayes Model:

Utilizes TF-IDF scores with both unigrams and bigrams.
Serves as a baseline model for comparison.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Models:

Bi-LSTM Model: A simple Bidirectional LSTM model as the initial RNN approach.
Bi-LSTM-CNN Model: Combines Bi-LSTM with Convolutional Neural Networks for improved feature extraction.
